# climate_media_messaging

Welcome to the repo. The aim of this project is to analyze the stance and biases of mainstream media outlets' response to climate change. The final results and written report can be found in the PDF file. The interested reader is invited to look at the code in the Jupyter notebooks, though these are rough drafts. Future versions will work on organizing these scripts and improving reproducibility of results.
